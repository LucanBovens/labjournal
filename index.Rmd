<!--- This is the best way to write a comment. 
It also demonstrate, you can add html directly in your rmarkdown file. See: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp ---> 


<!--- to use a multi column page we use Pandoc's fenced Div. 
see here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/multi-column.html 
But please note, we are not here to make a beautiful website, our intention is just to have a quick lab journal up and running --->

## How to navigate

This website has been hosted using Github. To navigate this website, please see the top menu. In the top menu, it is possible to find the different 'chapters' of this Lab Journal. It consists of weekly chapters added to the lab journal, which can be found under the 'my journal' tab. Under the 'concept report' tab, you can (in the future) find my concept report. The same goes for the 'final report' tab, where I will publish my final report on network analysis. This lab journal is for the end product of the course Social Networks. Most is based on the book Social Network Analysis For Social Scientists [@SNASS].
