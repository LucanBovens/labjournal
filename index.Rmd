<!--- to use a multi column page we use Pandoc's fenced Div. 
see here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/multi-column.html

## How to navigate

This website has been hosted using Github. To navigate this website, use the top menu. In the top menu, it is possible to find the different 'chapters' of this Lab Journal. It consists of weekly chapters added to the lab journal, which can be found under the 'my journal' tab. Under the 'concept report' tab, you can find some part of my concept report. The 'final report' tab is the most important tab, as you can find my final report on network analysis there. This lab journal is for the end product of the course Social Networks. Most is based on the book Social Network Analysis For Social Scientists (Tolsma & Hofstra, 2022).
